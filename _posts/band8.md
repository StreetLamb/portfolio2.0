Band8 is a wearable device that tracks the anxiety level of children with autism and alert "lifesavers" whenever they experience heightened anxiety.

It uses an Arduino as a microcontroller and makes use of heart-rate, GSR, and gyroscope sensors to measure anxiety levels. Whenever a child experienced heightened anxiety, it will send a message via the wifi module to Telegram where Lifesavers can then receive information on the child's whereabouts, next-of-kin information, as well as personalized guiding steps to calm the child down.
