The quarantine has impacted everyone socially. Many Singaporeans adapted to the situation and are hanging with their friends on Zoom, HouseParty, and even watching tv shows using the NetflixParty extension!

I decided instead of watching tv shows with just your friends, what if we could watch it with other Singaporeans that share the same common interest in shows? Therefore, I set my mind to create NetflixPartyAnimals bot on Telegram so that Singaporeans can organize Netflix parties and watch + laugh at our favorite shows together.

Through the NetflixPartyAnimals bot, anyone can set up a NetflixParty event and it will be broadcasted on the NetflixPartyAnimals channel. Anyone will be able to join the event and watch shows together!

At its peak, NetflixPartyAnimals had close to 300 members, and members were actively 'jio-ing' one another to watch their favourite shows together. It was heart-warming to see how much of an impact it had on others!
