_NaggingWallet is a solo project built on an idea that won us first place in Hack Mental Health hackathon @ UCSF in 2019. Read the medium article [here](https://medium.com/hackmentalhealth/compulsive-buying-disorder-winning-hackmentalhealth-2019-42db168d31c4)!_

Online shopping allows us to purchase items with greater ease, but this also means our money gets spent with greater ease too! I decided to create NaggingWallet, a chrome extension that persuades you to make better online shopping decisions through an inconvenient design. This means manipulating the site such as making the purchase button less attractive to click, removing ads, creating prompts that act as safety nets to ensure that you only purchase what you need, and many others! It also helps keep track of your online spendings.

Here are some of the more prominent features:

- Feel guilty about spending money before you purchase!

- Create a budget that updates as you spend money. Your budget shows up as you shop online so you know your spending limits.

- Remove clutter and distractions on pages that might make you spend more while you shop.

Currently, NaggingWallet only works on Amazon, Shopee, and Lazada.
