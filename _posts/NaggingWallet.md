The quarantine has impacted everyone socially. Many Singaporeans adapted to the situation and are hanging with their friends on Zoom, HouseParty, and even watching tv shows using the NetflixParty extension!

I decided instead of watching tv shows with just your friends, what if we could watch it with other Singaporeans that share the same common interest in shows? Therefore, I set my mind to create NetflixPartyAnimals bot on Telegram so that Singaporeans can organize Netflix parties and watch + laugh at our favorite shows together.

Through the NetflixPartyAnimals bot, anyone can set up a NetflixParty event and it will be broadcasted on the NetflixPartyAnimals channel. Anyone will be able to join the event and watch shows together!
