The Pomodoro Technique is widely used to helps users with their time management when working on multiple tasks. The technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo and was named after the Italian word for tomato as Cirillo utilised a tomato-shaped kitchen timer while he was a university student.

The Pomodoro app allows users to input the tasks to be completed for the day, and it will then show the estimated number of Pomodoros and the time to complete all the tasks. The timer will then countdown and send notifications to users to take a break and start working again.

The Pomodoro app was built with SwiftUI using the MVVM pattern. I had lots of fun working on it and it exposed me to many useful swift functions that I have now a better understanding of.
