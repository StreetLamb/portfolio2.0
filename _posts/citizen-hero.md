> _“I've lived next to the same family for 12 years, and while we do say hi from time to time, I don't know much about them - not even their names” - Celine Chan, 23_

Many of us Singaporeans identify a lot to Celine Chan. I too find it challenging connecting with my neighbors. The majority of Singaporeans do not talk to them or even know who their neighbors are.

In fact, a survey done by the Singapore Kindness Movement in 2017 found that Singaporeans are caring less for neighborliness, and are interacting lesser every year. Yet, a strong neighborhood community means a community that can help one another, keep each other safe, and even have fun together.

I built Citizen Hero, an app to make it easier to bring neighbors together and show them the benefits of a strong neighborhood community. Through this app, neighbors can help one another run errands, socialize by creating events and inviting their neighbors, report safety issues and crimes, as well as, to sell or give away goods.
