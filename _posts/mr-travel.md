The market is oversaturated with thousands of apps such as MyTransport, SG Buses etc. that caters to helping you get around Singapore. So why do we need yet another app??

Take a look at how many transport apps you have on your phone. Why do you have so many of them? Well its because every one of them do not cater to ALL your transportation needs. One might be specialised in getting bus timings and another in helping you get directions to your destination. What if we combine all of them and create something that has the features of all these apps?

I hope to reduce the need for so many transport apps, as well as creating a bot that is simple and user-friendly. A bot that can also be used on all your devices such as your phones, computers etc.
