We partnered with the Ester team in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to develop a wheelchair that could provide wheelchair users with more freedom.

They explained to us that a significant number of elderlies do not turn up for their appointments when it is raining. This is a significant problem as Singapore has an average of 167 days of high rainfall, and 28% of our population will be aged 65 and above by 2030.

After multiple iterations and interviews with patients, caregivers, and our stakeholders, we designed a wheelchair add-on that would be able to protect users, caregivers from both the rain and the sun. Our innovative design also allows the wheelchair and the shelter add-on to be easily stowed away.

It was a fulfilling project and the Ester team was very impressed with our work! They even treated us to dinner! We have filed a provisional patent and are currently in discussion for SGH to adopt the design in their hospitals.
